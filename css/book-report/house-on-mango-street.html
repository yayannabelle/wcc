                Sandra Cisneros (born December 20, 1954) is an American writer best known for her acclaimed first novel <em>The House on Mango Street</em> (1984) and her subsequent short story collection, <em>Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories</em> (1991). Cisnero's work experiments with literary forms and investigates emerging subject positions, which Cisneros herself attributes to growing up in a context of cultural hybridity and economic inequality that endowed her with unique stories to tell. Cisneros is the recipient of numerous awards including a <em>National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship</em>, and is regarded as a key figure in Chicana literature.
